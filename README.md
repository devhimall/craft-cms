# Craft CMS Assignment Description  

To set up the Amara project locally, I ran all the necessary commands for the initial setup.  

To create the card fields, I navigated to **Settings > Fields**, where I created a group named **"Molecules - Card"**. Within this group, I created a block type called **"P Card"** under the common fields.  

Next, I went to **Entries > Pages**, where I created an entry named **Card1**. In this entry, I defined or uploaded the required data.  

Finally, I began working on fetching the data for the frontend, focusing on the **component** folder.
